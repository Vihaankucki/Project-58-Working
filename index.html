      A Hobby That I Enjoy My favorite past time is to spend time at the computer, even at a tender age I like computer systems. To having a computer was a dream, an almost impossible dream.

I had a friend named George at that time, we were in the same school, same grade and we had a very good relationship. At that time he had a computer system and we spend our free time playing games, printing greeting cards, banners, we also did our school home work.
